tower-track-ch
==============

This is a mobile web app that shows the promixity of the user to the nearest radio communication tower. This allows a user without reception to know in which direction to walk to get a signal, or for people trying to go as offline as possible to find the nearest “hole” in reception.

Note: as signal quality varies strongly depending on the height difference and topography of the land, distance alone is not enough to paint an accurate picture of signal reception. This app may not be relied upon in an emergency.

This was originally started as a [Make.Opendata.ch](http://make.opendata.ch/wiki/project:mobility:gsm-towers) project, which has more background on the data used.

The code was developed with the Firefox OS toolkit, and is available in the Swiss Firefox app store.
