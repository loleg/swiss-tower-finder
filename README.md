Tower Track (CH)
================

This is a mobile web app that shows the promixity of the user to the nearest radio communication tower in Switzerland. 

This allows a user without reception to know in which direction to walk to get a signal, or for people trying to go as offline as possible to find the nearest “hole” in reception.

Note: as signal quality varies strongly depending on the height difference and topography of the land, distance alone is not enough to paint an accurate picture of signal reception. This app may not be relied upon in an emergency.

Maps and geographic data for the application are provided by [GeoAdmin](http://geo.admin.ch), and are copyright (C) Swisstopo.

Tower Track started as a [Make.Opendata.ch](http://make.opendata.ch/wiki/project:mobility:gsm-towers) project.

The code was developed with the Firefox OS toolkit, and is available in the Swiss Firefox app store.
